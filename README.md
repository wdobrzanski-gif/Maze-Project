In this assignment you will write a program that determines whether there is a way to exit
a maze, using stacks and queues to help guide the exploration.

This project:
- I write Python code that raises exceptions.
- I write Python code that uses the assert statement to check preconditions.
- Given a description of an ADTs operations, I implement that ADT in Python.
- I write Python programs that use the doctest module.
- I test Python code using the pytest module.
